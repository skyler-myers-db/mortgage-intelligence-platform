"""Health endpoint with live dependency status + breaker snapshot.

Slice-6/7 contract (returned body):

    {
      "status":            "ok" | "degraded",
      "mode":              "live",
      "app_env":           "<env>",
      "warehouse_id":      "<id>",
      "dependencies": {
        "warehouse":       "up" | "down",
        "lakebase":        "up" | "down",
        "genie":           "up" | "down"
      },
      "circuit_breakers": {
        "warehouse":       "closed" | "open" | "half_open",
        "lakebase":        "closed" | "open" | "half_open",
        "genie":           "closed" | "open" | "half_open"
      }
    }

A degraded response STILL returns HTTP 200 so the Databricks App load
balancer doesn't yank the container. Degraded state is carried in the
body, which the frontend reads to show the banner.

Each dependency probe is a lightweight ping with a 1-second timeout.
Warehouse / Lakebase probes issue ``SELECT 1``; Genie probes hit
``GET /spaces/{id}``. Failures do not raise; they flip the dependency
status to ``down`` and bump the breaker's failure counter. The
frontend's degraded banner auto-retries until ``status == "ok"``.
