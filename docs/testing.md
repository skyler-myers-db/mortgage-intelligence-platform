# Testing strategy

## Unit tests

- Scoring functions.
- Offer rules.
- Evidence formatting.
- Pydantic schema validation.
- Frontend component rendering.

## Integration tests

- API health.
- Portfolio preview.
- Borrower detail.
- Offer recommendation.
- Approval writes audit.
- Genie fallback.

## E2E tests

Playwright path:

1. Open home.
2. Build portfolio.
3. Select Prime Refi Candidates segment.
4. Open lead queue.
5. Expand borrower.
6. Open Borrower 360.
7. Generate offer.
8. Approve outreach.
9. Confirm audit row.

## Acceptance tests

The app runs on live Unity Catalog + Lakebase; there is no mock-mode runtime path (see [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) "Negative prompting"). Test criteria pin the live-data resilience contract instead.

- Evidence drawer opens from every KPI/score/recommendation and cites a real UC row.
- Human approval writes a real row to `mip_app.action_audit` in Lakebase.
- Borrower display fields pass PII redaction (initials only; generalized `{city}, {state} {zip}`).
- Degraded-state banner renders when warehouse / Genie / Lakebase drops, and clears on recovery — no silent mock fallback.
- Circuit breaker opens on SQL timeout; routes return 503 with `retry-after`, not stale mock data.
- Route p95 under live load stays inside the thresholds in [docs/load-baseline.md](load-baseline.md).
