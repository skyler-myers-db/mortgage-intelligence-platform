/**
 * GenieAnswer.stripQuestionRestatement is the small piece of pre-render
 * normalization that drops Genie's habit of opening with "You want to
 * see...". The actual answer below the preamble is what we want shown.
 *
 * Test policy: only strip when the FIRST sentence is an obvious
 * restatement leader; never blow away an answer that starts with "You"
 * for unrelated reasons (e.g. "You can refinance ..." would be a real
 * answer about the user, not a restatement).
